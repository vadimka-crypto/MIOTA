desc="IOTA [MIOTA], IOTA is a distributed ledger with one big difference: it isn’t actually a blockchain. Instead, its proprietary technology is known as Tangle, a system of nodes that confirm transactions. The foundation behind this platform says this offers far greater speeds than conventional blockchains — and an ideal footprint for the ever-expanding Internet of Things ecosystem."
conditions="There will only ever be 10.000.000 IOTA tokens in honor and support of law enforcement Now and Forever. Issuer Allows Any Stellar Account To Add This Asset. "
